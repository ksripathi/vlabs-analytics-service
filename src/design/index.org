* Introduction 
  The =design= of the =Analytics Service= is captured here.

* Architecture diagram
  Refer the diagram given below - 
  [[https://github.com/openedx-vlead/port-labs-to-openedx/blob/develop/src/analytics-setup/presentations/sprint2/images/VLABS%20Open%20edx%20Architecture%20Diagram.jpg][VLABS architecture diagram]]

  OpenedX server ---- POST ---->> Analytics API ---- POST ---->> Elasticsearch
  
* Flow 
    + As per the design, students will visit VLABS OpenedX and will
    access a Lab. When a student clicks an experiment section to
    perform an experiment, data related to the experiment (Experiment
    name, Experiment ID, Lab name, Lab ID, User ID) is POSTed to
    Analytics API server.
  + Analytics API server further evaluates the IP address of the
    client and obtains (GET) the location of the IP address using
    http://freegeoip.net/json/<your-ip-address>.
  + Analytics API server then POST the data to Elasticsearch in JSON
    format.
  + Kibana using its visualization then represents the graphs
    obtained.
  + Information on implementation of ELK node can be [[https://github.com/openedx-vlead/elk-stack-for-analytics][read here]]
